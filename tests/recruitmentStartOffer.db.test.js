/**
 * THE OFFER-BYPASS GAP, AND THE FIX.
 *
 * WHAT THE MANUAL UI TEST FOUND: a candidate in the Offered column had a "Hire this
 * candidate" button that called `hireCandidate` directly. That function creates the
 * employee record and drafts the letter, and then stops — so a real person landed on
 * the payroll whose offer was never submitted, never approved, and never sent. The
 * employee row is the one write in this module the UI cannot undo, and it was the one
 * write with no enforced follow-up.
 *
 * THE FIX IS `startCandidateOffer`, and these tests pin the two properties that close
 * it:
 *
 *   1. THE PIPELINE'S ENTRY POINT ALWAYS SUBMITS THE APPROVAL. There is no code path
 *      from the pipeline that creates an employee without an approval chain, so the
 *      state that was found in testing is now unreachable through the UI.
 *
 *   2. THE APPROVED-AND-SENT OFFER IS STILL REQUIRED BEFORE THE LETTER CAN BE ISSUED.
 *      Enforced by `sendOffer`, not by the hire — because the letter is minted BY the
 *      hire. Inverting that (requiring a sent letter before the hire) is a deadlock:
 *      the letter only exists after the hire, so nothing could ever be hired.
 *
 * Plus the preflight: a misconfigured approval workflow must be caught BEFORE the
 * employee exists, because there is no undo for a committed hire.
