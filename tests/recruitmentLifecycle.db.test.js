/**
 * THE LIFECYCLE THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR.
 *
 * Job opening -> application -> screening -> interview -> offered -> hired, with the
 * hire producing a REAL employee row and an offer letter, all in one transaction.
 *
 * WHY A REAL DATABASE. Every meaningful rule here is a WHERE clause or a foreign
 * key rather than an `if`: the allowed-transition table, the one-shot conversion
 * guard (`converted_employee_uuid IS NULL AND stage='offered'`), the tenant foreign
 * keys, the duplicate-application unique key, the interview double-booking key. A
 * mocked pool can be told to return success; it cannot tell you a query refuses to
 * match a row it should not, and that refusal IS the guarantee. The 20261115 schema
 * probe also showed the tenant FKs silently allowing a NULL department_id through,
 * which is exactly the class of thing only a live database reveals.
 *
 * ISOLATION. Each test builds its own opening. Vacancy counts are per-opening and
 * the pipeline board counts per-opening, so a shared fixture would make the hire
 * tests order-dependent.
