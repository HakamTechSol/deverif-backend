/**
 * ROUTE-LEVEL AUTH MATRIX: every recruitment route x every persona.
 *
 * The failure this pins is the one the last audit found across six other modules: a
 * route whose gate names a ROLE but no PERMISSION, so every sub-admin reaches it
 * whatever an org admin configured. Reading a routes file cannot catch that, because
 * every line of a role-only gate looks correct — the defect is an ABSENCE.
 *
 * So this drives the real router with real signed tokens against the real middleware
 * chain. A gate is a list of functions, and the only way to know a route's list is
 * right is to execute it.
 *
 * FOUR PERSONAS, because each fails differently:
 *
 *   org_admin_holding_nothing   passes on the ROLE. If a permission were checked
 *                               before the role, org_admins would be locked out of
 *                               their own company — the most damaging possible
 *                               regression and the one a role-only test cannot see.
 *   sub_admin_with              exactly the one permission this module needs.
 *   sub_admin_without           nothing at all. The reported bug.
 *   employee                     everything, which must still be refused: a
 *                               permission must never become a back door past the
 *                               role.
 *
 * NOTHING IS MOCKED, including requireRole. Mocking it would make this file assert
 * that a stub behaves as intended, which is what the offboarding test accidentally
 * did when its stub stopped setting req.user.
