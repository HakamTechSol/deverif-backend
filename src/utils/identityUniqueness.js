/**

 * The database enforces this (uq_users_phone_normalized, and the existing UNIQUE
 * on cnic), so a duplicate can never be stored. That guarantee is deliberately in
 * the schema rather than in these checks, because there are seven code paths that
 * write users.phone and any one of them could forget a guard.
 *
 * What lives here is the part the database cannot do: saying something useful.
 * A raw driver error reads "Duplicate entry '3127464847' for key
 * 'uq_users_phone_normalized'", which names an internal index, shows a mangled
 * number, and does not tell the person doing the data entry whose number it is or
 * which field to fix. These helpers turn that into a 409 a human can act on.

/**
 * One email address, one identity — across BOTH `users` and `employees`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST THE DATABASE'S JOB
 *     `users.email` is UNIQUE, so two login accounts can never share one. But
 *     `employees.email` has no unique constraint and, until the migration
 *     alongside this file, no index at all. So an employee row and a user row
 *     could both hold the same address and the database was perfectly happy:
 *     the person ended up with an HR record showing "no portal access" and a
 *     separate login that nothing pointed at. `employees.linked_user_uuid` is
 *     what ties the two together, and creating a user through the admin path
 *     never set it.
 *
 *     One person must not exist as an unlinked employee AND an unrelated
 *     account. That split is invisible in the UI (the employee keeps claiming
 *     no portal access forever) and unfixable once the two have diverged.
 *
 * WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN LINKS
 *     utils/services/employeeAccess.service.js deliberately never links
 *     accounts by email alone, and that judgement still holds here: emails get
 *     shared, mistyped and reassigned, and silently merging two records on a
 *     string match is worse than refusing. The intended path for giving an
 *     employee portal access is that service, which creates the account AND
 *     writes `is_platform_user='yes', linked_user_uuid=...` in one transaction.
 *     This check exists to make sure nobody reaches it by the side door.
 *
 * `linkedUserUuid` is what keeps the check from firing on the legitimate pairs.
 * An employee already linked to the account being edited IS the same person,
 * re-saving their own profile must not report them as a duplicate of
 * themselves — the same reason `excludeUserId` exists above.
